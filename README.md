# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a online chat client built with `Socket.io`, `Flask`, `Python` and `HTML/CSS`. The JavaScript and Style files are located in the static folder. Since
this web app only has one page, the `index.html` is located in templates. The `application.py` is written in Python, and is the driver of the web app. `index.js` defined most
of the app's logic, including the functionality of buttons and the `innerHTML` of the `<div>` tags in the HTML file.

The personal touch I added in the project is that the user can click the `Change Name` button on the upper right corner to switch identities. This might come in handy when
multiple people are sharing a computer/browser.
